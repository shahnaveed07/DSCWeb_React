# DSCWeb_React

Production-grade React application for **Dark Skull Corporation** (`https://dscweb.me/`).

This modern React single-page application replaces the legacy monolithic website. It preserves the existing authentication, role verification, order processing, and administrative system contracts while providing a resilient, responsive, accessible, and maintainable user experience.

## 3. Deployment Configuration (Netlify)

This project is configured for deployment on **Netlify**:

- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist`
- **Single Page Application Routing:**
  - Configured via `netlify.toml` and `public/_redirects` (`/* /index.html 200`).
  - All direct client-side routes, refreshes, and deep links cleanly resolve through `index.html` to React Router.

## 4. Environment Variables

Define the following environment variables in `.env` (or via the Netlify dashboard under **Site configuration > Environment variables**):

| Variable | Description | Default / Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the DSC backend API | `https://dscauth.onrender.com` |

- `POST /api/admin/login` — Administrator authentication.
- `GET /api/auth/my-order` — User order and subscription details.

## 7. Security & Release Verification

1. **No Embedded Secrets:** All credentials, tokens, and customer data are stored exclusively in client memory / session storage with automatic expiration and logout on 401/403.
2. **Error Boundary:** Top-level React `ErrorBoundary` prevents white-screen crashes and provides safe recovery routes.
3. **Double Submission Protection:** All authentication and payment forms lock input fields and disable submit buttons during in-flight network requests.
4. **Maintenance Exemption:** Admin authentication routes remain reachable during maintenance mode to ensure administrators can authenticate and toggle maintenance off.
5. **Theme Consistency:** Native Light and Dark themes conform to WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA contrast guidelines without color flash on initial load.
